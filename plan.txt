In this program, hitting F5 starts and stops a timer.
Each time the timer stops, the time elapsed will be put into a variable.
On the first keypress, the first coding session timer will start.
On the second keypress, the first coding timer will stop, and the first break timer will start.
this pattern will continue with each new keypress.

Pressing F6 will end whatever timer is ticking, and compile all code and break variables into a
readable format, which will be displayed to the user.
example:
    #Total coding time: 4 hours and 12 minutes
    #session 1 time: 2 hours and 12 minutes
    #break 1 time: 31 minutes
    #session 2 time: 2 hours

TODO:
    fix up the text formatting
    write the session info into files and folders based on the current date.
