In this program, hitting F5 starts and stops a timer.
Each time the timer stops, the time elapsed will be put into a variable.
On the first keypress, the first coding session timer will start.
On the second keypress, the first coding timer will stop, and the first break timer will start.
this pattern will continue with each new keypress.

Pressing F6 will end whatever timer is ticking, and compile all code and break variables into a
readable format, which will be displayed to the user.
example:
    #Total coding time: 4 hours and 12 minutes
    #session 1 time: 2 hours and 12 minutes
    #break 1 time: 31 minutes
    #session 2 time: 2 hours

TODO:
    Figure out why the timer takes so long to start.
    If page up is pressed before the timer starts, the timer variable is not updated, and a large number is generated.

IDEAS: 
    If the current day in the xml file is already there, read and append the extra session data to the end.

    Import the created files into a line graph program, which can be shown on a future portfolio website.
    To do this, the data should be in a format that a line graph could read, like an int.
